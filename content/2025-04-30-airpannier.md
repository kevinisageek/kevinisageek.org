Still cycling to work, albeit [I have got a car now](/2024/04/08/carfree/) for the trips where 2 folk are going. The biggest issue I've found is carrying the stuff needed for the shift, whether that's in a backpack or a dedicated pannier bag.

I bought an [Ortleib Vario](https://uk.ortlieb.com/products/vario), thinking it would be good for switching between backpack and pannier modes, and for the most part it is. Except when in pannier mode, the laptop sleeve is on the outside, vulnerable to bollards, vehicles, the ground, etc. Not too terrible with [eBay Thinkpads](https://kevinisageek.org/2022/11/06/buy-thinkpads/) but since I got a [Framework](https://frame.work/gb/en/laptop13), having that battered about is a bit of a concern.

I figured, since the commute isn't that long, I could go with a backpack for better protection, so I got a [Goruck GR2](https://www.goruck.com/en-gb/products/gr2) as a one bag that can handle most things. However, I forgot just how horribly damp backpacks make things. Especially with summer coming up. I began figuring out how to get something of a compromise, strap the backpack to the bike rack.

My research brought me to the [Mundo AirPannier](https://www.mundomusicgear.co.uk/products/airpannier), basically a pile of cargo net, carabiners and straps. The idea being that the contraption is hooked onto a pannier rack and a bag (or a myriad of musical instruments) can be inserted and securely transported without the icky damp that would otherwise result.

Having ridden using it a few times, the biggest issue is getting the bag to sit in the net. Given its just a simple light net, it tends to collapse and sag which is mildly annoying when trying to wrangle the bag around straps. Once the bag is in and secured with the [ROK strap](https://www.rokstraps.co.uk/products/pack-stretch-strap), its secure and stable. Just need to ensure any loose ends are tucked in and don't foul on the wheel (had that happen, ripping a strap out of a previous backpack while blasting downhill at 20+mph).

For the money, it is a bit pricy, considering that all it is is 2 nylon straps, carabiners, a net and the aforementioned ROK cord but as it is assembled here in the UK and fits my need without any modification I'll let it slide.
