Now it is accessible via [IPv6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6).

`/etc/network/interfaces`:

```console
iface enp3s0 inet6 static
    address 2602:ff16:6:0:1:1e6:0:1
    netmask 64
    gateway 2a03:b0c0:2:d0::1
    autoconf 0
    dns-nameservers 2001:4860:4860::8844 2001:4860:4860::8888 209.244.0.3
```

Reboot, add an [AAAA record](https://support.dnsimple.com/articles/aaaa-record/) to my [DNS registrar](https://www.gandi.net/en) and away to the races!
